# *OpenCV-Python-Game*
> ## Game Description:
   * By using OpenCV library with python, able to implement this game, it video game when game start your webcam          
   open and your work to push buttons that appear on screen. i used openCV and cvzone libraries with python to access camera and detect position of hand.
   * To calculate distance of hand from camera, i do sequence of trail and collect data between x and y, where
    x &#x2192; represent distance between point (5) and (17) in image bellow
    y &#x2192; reprecent actual distance in centimeters
    this is one challenge of project to find relation to relate x and y, as relation is nonlinear.
   * Store players names and their scores in a file `Players.txt` and display at end of game max score till now.
